    "bio": "I build systems to explore data in immersive environments. My work focuses on the development of virtual reality (VR) applications and high-performance computer graphics systems. I am currently working towards my PhD in Computer Science at <a href='https://vidi.cs.ucdavis.edu/' target='_blank'>VIDi Labs</a> with my advisor <a href='https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma/' target='_blank'>Kwan-Liu Ma</a>. Before moving to the U.S., I was engaged in multiple projects with topics ranging from cryptocurrencies to deep learning. After graduating from the Vienna University of Technology under <a href='https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/staff/EduardGroeller.html' target='_blank'>Eduard Gröller</a> I worked with <a href='https://imagebiopsylab.com' target='_blank'>ImageBiopsy Lab</a> for about a year. After that I decided to join Kwan-Liu Ma at his VIDi Design Lab at UC Davis.",
